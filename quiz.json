    "question": "You are running an application using Elastic Container Service (ECS). You would like to use the most cost-effective approach. Which task placement strategy would you choose to achieve your desired result?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "binpack",
      "b": "random",
      "c": "spread"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "a",
    "explanation": "Explanation: Tasks are placed on container instances so as to leave the least amount of unused CPU or memory.

The lesser the number of instances, the cost is lower."
