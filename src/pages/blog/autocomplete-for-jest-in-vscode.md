## Problem Background

I am writing unit tests for my Node application using Jest. However, I encountered an issue which is the VsCode Intellisense (code autocomplete) is not working.

Referring to the documentation is pretty troublesome and not productive too.

So, how do I get my VSCode Intellisense for Jest?

## Solution

The solution turned out seems to be pretty easy after read through the Github issue.

We just have to install the `@types/jest` as our development dependencies.

```
npm i -D @types/jest
```

Happy coding. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
